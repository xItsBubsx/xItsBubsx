- 👋 Hi, I’m @xItsBubsx
- 👀 I’m interested in playing games and learning new things in many different areas!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to adjust scripts in Fivem due to so many people not being able to follow through with the task at hand
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FiveM ideas, scripts, knowledge on writing or coding
- 📫 How to reach me toywars0312@gmail.com and we can most definitely take it from there if all works out or just to have someone to talk to!!!
